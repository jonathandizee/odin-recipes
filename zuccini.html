    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a yummy rice skillet with pork chop, zucchini, and Parmesan cheese. You don't need a lot of oil for this recipe - chicken broth does the trick.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pork chop, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 cups of chicken broth and brown rice in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat and cook pork until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini and cook for 3 minutes. Add 1 cup chicken broth and simmer until zucchini are soft, about 5 minutes. Add rice. Mix in green onions, rosemary, and Parmesan cheese and cook until well combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
