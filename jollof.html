    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> West Africas most popular dish. I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>minced ginger</li>
        <li>water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.</li>
    </ol>
